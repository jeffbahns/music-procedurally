-->> v1 (complete, stored in archive/v1)
This was developed in about a week for a computer science object
oriented design course (SSU CS-360).

At this stage in development, the program offered a fairly
simple interface that allowed the user to randomly generate simple
musical patterns with a few clicks, played through a set of synthesizer instruments

-->> v2 (WIP)
Version 2's goal is to create music using a modified version of
Conway's Game of Life. This was developed for a Theory of
Computatino course (SSU CS-454) under Professor Ravikumar.
