# music-procedurally
Procedural music generator

-->> v1 (complete, stored in archive/v1)
This was developed in about a week for a computer science object
oriented design course (SSU CS-360).

At this stage in development, the program offered a fairly
simple interface that allowed the user to randomly generate simple
musical patterns with a few clicks, played through a set of synthesizer instruments

-->> v2 (WIP)
Version 2's goal is to create music using a probabilistic approach.
It will also involve graphics to help create a more engaging
project.
